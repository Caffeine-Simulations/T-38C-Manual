T-38C Pilots fly with an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) running apps like Foreflight to assist in navigation, flight planning, approach/departure charts, and much more. This can be replicated externally, even on a separate device like a tablet using the Navigraph Suite of applications Note Navigraph is a Paid service, more information can be found here . Navigraph Charts Navigraph Charts is an app that essentially replicates Foreflight, but in the Simulator environment. With a Navigraph Subscription, you can access charts, plan a flight, see your GPS position and various performance numbers (if using Simlink). The Charts App can be run on either the same device as your DCS install, or on a tablet, externally (for example attached to your thigh like a kneeboard). Simlink Warning This Feature is not yet available to testers TODO remove this message when the time is right With a Navigraph subscription, you will be able to download the Simlink application, and install the DCS Simlink Plugin into your Saved Games/Scripts/Hooks Directory.

T-38C Pilots fly with an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) running apps like Foreflight to assist in navigation, flight planning, approach/departure charts, and much more.
