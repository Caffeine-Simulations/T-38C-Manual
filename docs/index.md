# DCS: T-38C Talon
## Introduction
The T-38C by Caffeine Simulations, is a free advanced jet trainer built for the combat flight simulator DCS World. Our Mission is to provide a platform to facilitate advanced training for 4th Gen DCS Fighters in Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Basic Surface Attack (BSA), along with multiship formation flying and tactics.

The T-38C has a highly complex navigation system, which we have Transposed into DCS World. 

!!! Note
    For the best experience we recommend using the NTTR (Nevada) map by Eagle Dynamics, although all other maps will work.
